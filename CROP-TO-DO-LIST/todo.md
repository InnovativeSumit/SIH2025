## Todo List Enhancement Plan

### Phase 2: Design advanced todo list features and architecture
- [x] Brainstorm and list advanced features.
- [x] Outline architectural changes for new features.
- [x] Define UI/UX improvements.

### Phase 3: Develop enhanced todo list application with modern React features
- [x] Implement task persistence using local storage.
- [x] Add task editing functionality.
- [x] Add task deletion functionality.
- [x] Implement due dates and priorities for tasks.
- [x] Enhance UI/UX with improved styling and responsiveness.
- [x] Implement task filtering and sorting.

### Phase 4: Create comprehensive README.md documentation
- [x] Document installation and setup instructions.
- [x] Explain application features.
- [x] Provide usage examples.
- [x] Detail project structure.
- [x] Include technologies used.

### Phase 5: Test application functionality and create final zip package
- [ ] Perform functional testing of all new features.
- [ ] Ensure `npm install` and `npm run dev` work correctly.
- [ ] Create a zip archive of the complete project.

### Phase 6: Deliver complete application package to user
- [ ] Send the zip file and README.md to the user.




### Brainstormed Advanced Features:
- **User Authentication:** Allow users to create accounts and manage their own todo lists.
- **Task Persistence:** Save tasks to a backend or local storage so they are not lost on refresh.
- **Task Editing and Deletion:** Allow users to modify existing tasks and remove completed/unwanted tasks.
- **Due Dates and Priorities:** Add fields for due dates and priority levels to tasks.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Enable filtering tasks by column, due date, priority, and sorting by various criteria.
- **Notifications:** Implement reminders for upcoming due dates.
- **Subtasks:** Allow breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- **Search Functionality:** Enable searching for tasks by keywords.
- **Improved UI/UX:** More modern and intuitive design, animations, and responsiveness.
- **Drag and Drop Enhancements:** More visual feedback during drag and drop operations.
- **Dark Mode:** Option to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Integration with external calendars (stretch goal):** Sync due dates with Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar.





### Architectural Changes:
- **Local Storage Integration:** Implement `localStorage` to persist tasks across sessions. This will involve modifying `setTasks` to also update local storage and `useState` initialization to read from local storage.
- **State Management Refinement:** While `useState` is sufficient for this scale, consider a more centralized context for task management if complexity grows significantly (though not strictly necessary for this iteration).
- **Component Refactoring:** Potentially refactor `Task.tsx` and `Column.tsx` to handle new features like editing, deletion, due dates, and priorities more cleanly.

### UI/UX Improvements:
- **Task Card Enhancements:** Add visual indicators for due dates and priorities on task cards. Include edit and delete buttons.
- **Form Improvements:** Enhance the task input form to include fields for due date and priority.
- **Filtering/Sorting UI:** Add dropdowns or buttons for filtering and sorting tasks.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application looks good on various screen sizes (already partially handled by Tailwind, but will need specific adjustments for new elements).
- **Animations:** Add subtle animations for task addition, deletion, and drag-and-drop feedback.
- **Theming:** Implement a simple dark mode toggle using Tailwind CSS classes.
